# Team Portfolio Project

This repository hosts the **Team Portfolio Website**, a static web project showcasing the profiles, skills, and GitHub accounts of all team members.  
The system is designed, built, and deployed collaboratively on **GitHub Pages**.

---

## Project Overview

The **Team Portfolio** is a static website that introduces all The software engineering team members through an interactive homepage and individual profile pages.  
Each member’s page provides professional information, technical competencies, and links to their GitHub profiles.

## System Components

### 1. `index.html` (Root Document)
- Serves as the **main entry point** of the website.  
- Displays a list of all team members.  
- Each name is a **hyperlink** leading to the respective member’s profile page.

### 2. Individual Profile Pages (`firstname-lastname.html`)
Each team member creates their own HTML file containing:
- **Full Name**  
- **Short Professional Biography** (2–3 sentences)  
- **List of Technical Competencies** (e.g., Python, Java, CSS)  
- **Hyperlink to Personal GitHub Profile**
